# Assignment for Computational Physics Project

A distribution of charged particles in a plane generate an electric field    . In order to derive
the total electric field for a given position, the contribution of each particle needs to be
considered, based on the principle of superposition. In order to calculate correctly the electric
field in a plane, the x- and y-components of the electric field are needed.
In this assessment, the components Ex and Ey are provided in external files. The goals are 1) to calculate the resulting electric field
strength E in a plane; 2) to write E in a new file with a desired format, and 3) to plot E in the plane for a given value of y position.
